# video-preview

Coding Dojo Bootcamp May 2022 - js section - display in the browser

```Had to use the same video for all previews - GitHub didn't like sizes```
## I changed all the video names so it seems like different videos so the onmouseover and onmouseleave events would work for all videos. Video is large so take a while to load but you can see that it's starting and stoping with mouse over and leave
